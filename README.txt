There is not textfile reading at the moment.
Input has to be done manually.
	- Profit has not been fully flushed out yet; these commands won't return anything
	significant
	- Timestamps are timed at the time the program runs, so for any valid pricing you'd
	have to wait a minute or so for it to grant you the price.

However, I will provide sample inputs, but
timestamps will not work correctly.
